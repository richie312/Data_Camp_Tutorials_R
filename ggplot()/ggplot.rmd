## ggplot()

### Basic plot function; col arguement with factors

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Plot the correct variables of mtcars
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)

# Change cyl inside mtcars to a factor
mtcars$fcyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

# Make the same plot as in the first instruction
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$fcyl)
```


```{r, eval =FALSE}

# Use lm() to calculate a linear model and save it as carModel
carModel <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

# Basic plot
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)

# Call abline() with carModel as first argument and set lty to 2
abline(carModel, lty = 2)

# Plot each subset efficiently with lapply
# You don't have to edit this code
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)
lapply(mtcars$cyl, function(x) {
  abline(lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars, subset = (cyl == x)), col = x)
  })

# This code will draw the legend of the plot
# You don't have to edit this code
legend(x = 5, y = 33, legend = levels(mtcars$cyl),
       col = 1:3, pch = 1, bty = "n")

```



### PLot using mtcars

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
suppressPackageStartupMessages()
# Convert cyl to factor (don't need to change)
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

# Example from base R (don't need to change)
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)
abline(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars), lty = 2)
suppressWarnings(apply(mtcars$cyl, function(x) {
  abline(lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars, subset = (cyl == x)), col = x)
  }))
legend(x = 5, y = 33, legend = levels(mtcars$cyl),
       col = 1:3, pch = 1, bty = "n")

# Plot 1: add geom_point() to this command to create a scatter plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl)) +
  geom_point() # Fill in using instructions Plot 1

# Plot 2: include the lines of the linear models, per cyl
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl)) +
  geom_point()+ # Copy from Plot 1
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)   # Fill in using instructions Plot 2

# Plot 3: include a lm for the entire dataset in its whole
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl)) +
  geom_point() + # Copy from Plot 2
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + # Copy from Plot 2
  geom_smooth(aes(group = 1), method = "lm",se =FALSE,linetype = 2)  # Fill in using instructions Plot 3


```


##Variables to visuals, part 1


```{r, eval = FALSE}

##
# Load the tidyr package
library(tidyr)

# Fill in the ___ to produce to the correct iris.tidy dataset
iris.tidy <- iris %>%
  gather(key, Value, -Species) %>%
  separate(key, c("Part", "Measure"), "\\.")

## PLot using measure as facet

ggplot(iris.tidy, aes(x = Species, y = Value, col = Part)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_grid(. ~ Measure)

```

![iris.tidy_plot](D:/Documents/R_Projects/Data_Camp_Tutorials/ggplot()/iris.tidy_plot.JPG)

### Facets by Species

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Load the tidyr package
library(tidyr)

# Add column with unique ids (don't need to change)
iris$Flower <- 1:nrow(iris)

# Fill in the ___ to produce to the correct iris.wide dataset
iris.wide <- iris %>%
  gather(key, value, -Species, -Flower) %>%
  separate(key, c("Part", "Measure"), "\\.") %>%
  spread(Measure, value)

# The 3 data frames (iris, iris.wide and iris.tidy) are available in your environment
# Execute head() on iris, iris.wide and iris.tidy (in that order)

head(iris)
head(iris.wide)
head(iris.tidy)


# Think about which dataset you would use to get the plot shown right
# Fill in the ___ to produce the plot given to the right
ggplot(iris.wide, aes(x = Length, y = Width, color = Part)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_grid(. ~ Species)

```
